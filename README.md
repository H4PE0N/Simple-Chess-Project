# My Simple Chess Project
## Information about the project
This is my simple chess project. I wanted to create a simple chess program, that simulates a game of chess. I started with the rules of chess, and the implementation of the moves. Then I made a simple game, when you and your friend can play against each other. That would come to be the `multi-player-chess` program. Because I don't have any friends that wanted to play with me, I wanted to create a simple chess bot that I could play against. After many different versions of the bot, I have finally created a bot that is very smart. The game that you play agains the bot is called `single-player-chess`.
## Creating and running games
To play any of the game in this project, you will have to locate yourself in the `Binary-Program-Folder`, where all the binary/executable files is. Then you have to create the executable files if they don't already exists. To get the executable file for any of the games, you will type `make <game-name>`. The game-name, is one of the game-modes that is mentioned in the beginning. Then an executable file is going to appear. To execute the file / play the game, you will type `./<game-name>`. For example, if you want to play the `single-player-game`, you will first type `make single-player-game`, then `./single-player-game`.
## How to play the different games
### How to move a chess piece
When you are going to move a chess-piece on the board, you can always move the piece by writing the coordinate its on, and then the coordinate that you want to move to. For example, the move could look like `E7 E5`. That means that you want to move the piece on `E7` to `E5`. If you don't know what move to do, you can type the keyword `HINT`. That will print out a move for you to do, which has been calculated by the bot. If you want to let the computer move for you, just like the implemented bot would, you can type the keyword `HELP`. If you don't want to play anymore, you can always type the keyword `STOP`. That will stop the game, and let you know that the game ended with no winner.
### multi-player-chess:
When you start the game `multi-player-chess`, you will start as **WHITE**. When **WHITE** does his move, the turn will go over to **BLACK**, who the does his move. And then I just goes around that way, until the game is over. This game-mode require you to have a friend to play against. Then you and your friend will play against each other.
### single-player-chess:
If you are like me and don't have any friends, you can try to play the game `single-player-chess`. You start as **WHITE** and you do your move, then the turn goes over to **BLACK**, which is played by the bot. When you think about it, this game-mode is kind of depressing, but that's the game. You switch turns until one of you win or it becomes a draw.
